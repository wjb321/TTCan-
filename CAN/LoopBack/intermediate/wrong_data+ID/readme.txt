Problems:

do the loopback test, there are two different nodes A, B.
1) try these nodes with this code, but A generates the data is what I want, B has different data in CAN_DATA6 and 
CAN_DATA7 parts, when there are CAN_DATA0-7

2) 2 nodes they both have changed ID values. 
    for example: I set ID = 0x22,  while the serial ports show ID is 0xXX22, where XX means random values from 0-e in hex.
